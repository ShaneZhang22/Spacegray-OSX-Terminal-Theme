### Spacegray Theme For Mac Terminal

Once Yosemite came out I found that the stuff I used in iTerm2 was now in the standard terminal so I switched back! But I missed my favorite theme from iTerm2 so I created it for Mac terminal!

### Setup:

##### Method 1:

Download ZIP or clone repository

double click `spacegray.terminal`

Set profile as "Default"

##### Method 2:

Launch Terminal

In the top menu bar click Terminal -> Preferences (or âŒ˜,)

Go to "Profiles"

Click the Gear symbol

Click Import...

Click spacegray.terminal and press Open

Now set the profile as "Default" and you should be good!

#### Extra Info:
